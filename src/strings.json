Once that's done, water (and get visitors to water) your flowers everyday. In zone 1, except for the white roses, as soon as a flower couple breeds one of the flowers marked with a star in zone 2, move them to zone 2. The white roses must be children of the yellow and white rose couple.\n\nNow that you're in zone 2, once again, as soon as a couple produces a flower marked with a yellow star in zone 3, move them to zone 3. The exception is purple roses! When your purple/white couple has produced a purple rose, you need to keep the child apart and breed it with seed yellow roses. If they produce a yellow rose, the purple rose can proceed to zone 3. Once you get both purple and orange roses in zone 3, breed them until you get an orange rose, and move it to zone 4. Now all your zones are ready!\n\nIf you get five visitors to water your garden every day, this can take as little as 13 days! It can take 9 days if you double the layout as well (it's still less space than the 'A Lot!' option).\n\nYou can remove couples that already gave you all wanted hybrids if you want to conserve watering cans or space.\n\nNot depicted in the image are the endgame hybrids: in zone 2, orange cosmos make black; orange/yellow tulips make purple; and orange/yellow hyacinths make purple. In zone 3, red windflowers make purple, red pansies make purple, and purple mums make green. In zone 4, red/orange windflowers make pink, red/white mums make pink, red/yellow pansies make orange, red lilies make black and pink, red/yellow lilies make orange, red roses make black and pink, red tulips make black, red/white tulips make pink, red/white hyacinths make pink, white hyacinths make blue, orange roses make blue, and red/white cosmos make pink.",

Their children should be moved to the black/orange/red rose square.",
